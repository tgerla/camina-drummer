# carina-drummer
A drum loop player in Python.

Keys:

```
q - quit
[ - previous pattern
] - next pattern
spacebar - play/pause
+ - increase tempo
- - decrease tempo
```

This will eventually run on CircuitPython in a guitar pedal form factor.

The samples are from https://github.com/jstrait/beats and patterns are from https://github.com/montoyamoraga/drum-machine-patterns, using my script to convert them to YAML at https://github.com/tgerla/drum-machine-patterns.
